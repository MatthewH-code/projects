This object pack is optional. 

If you have the "xcam_prototype map" installed, then you don't need any of these pbo's,
otherwise copy all the pbo's you want to use, to the "@xCam\addons\" folder.

If you have the "African Foliage by Berghoff" installed, then copy the "xCam_brg_africa.pbo"
to the "@xCam\addons\" folder to have all these objects available within the X-Cam.
